# Transition from V4 to V5

Built into Cyberdrop-DL V5 is a tool that allows you to import both your configs and your history DB.

#### Importing previous configs <a href="#importing-previous-configs" id="importing-previous-configs"></a>

This is pretty straight forward. The config will be located in the folder that you were previously running Cyberdrop-DL in.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you weren't using the config previously, you don't need to import it.

However, if you were primarily using CLI Arguments with V4, some of the arguments you will need to swap into configs.
{% endhint %}

If you don't end up using the import feature, make sure you also change the default config in the program if that's something you want to do.

#### Importing the old History DB <a href="#importing-the-old-history-db" id="importing-the-old-history-db"></a>

For a lot of people, the `download_history.sqlite` file will be in the same folder as your start file (or wherever you are running Cyberdrop-DL).

If it's not there, you can find it here:

Windows: `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Cyberdrop-DL\Cyberdrop-DL\download_history.sqlite` Mac: `/Library/Application Support/Cyberdrop-DL/Cyberdrop-DL/download_history.sqlite` Linux: `/home/<USER>/.local/share/Cyberdrop-DL/Cyberdrop-DL/download_history.sqlite`

{% hint style="info" %}
The old `download_history.sqlite` file is no longer used by Cyberdrop-DL. After you import it, you can delete the old one.

If you don't want to import previous download history, you can just delete it.
{% endhint %}
