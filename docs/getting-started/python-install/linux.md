# Linux

You can quickly check if Python is installed by running the following command in the terminal:

```shell
python3 --version
```

If you get an error instead of a version number, try doing it simply as:

```shell
python --version
```

If the version number is 3.11, 3.12 or 3.13, you're all set!

If the version is below 3.11, you'll need to update Python.

If you encounter an error instead of a version number, you'll need to install Python.

Due to the variety of Linux distributions, it's not feasible to cover every installation or update method here. It's best to search on your own for instructions specific to your version of Linux on how to install or update Python.

Once the Python installation is complete, you can go ahead to [install Cyberdrop-DL](../cyberdrop-dl-install.md)
