# Installing cyberdrop-dl on Android

Cyberdrop-dl is a terminal app. That means you need a terminal emulator to run it. The defacto choice in Android is [termux](https://termux.dev/en/).


{% hint style="info" %}
Most of the dependencies need to be compiled from source. A rust compiler is required. This means the installation could take several minutes, especially on low end phones
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Compiling from source also requires a lot of extra storage. You will need at least 3.4GB just for the installation of CDL
{% endhint %}


## 1. Install `termux`

Termux wiki: [https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Installation](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Installation)

Install termux from [F-droid (recommended)](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) or from the [Google Playstore (restricted version)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux):
