# Windows

I'm thinking the majority of you new people will find yourself on this page, and hopefully I can steer you in the right directions!

First things first, lets see if you have python installed. You can do so by opening up command prompt and running the following command:

```powershell
python --version
```

If you see a version number that is 3.11 or newer, you're already set, and you can continue with the quick start guide!

If you see something lower than 3.11, you will need to uninstall it. You can do it by searching for "uninstall programs" on your machine, and finding python and going through the uninstall tool.

For those of you that see an error, or just uninstalled a lower version of python. Don't fret, it's easy to install the new version.

But first, a few notes:

* You don't always want the newest version of python.
* Python won't update itself if you install a different version, it'll install it as a separate version and this can cause issues.
* You probably don't need to ever update python.

You can find the installer here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you click the "**Add to Path**" checkbox! That is the one key part of installing python. If you don't you'll have to uninstall it and redo it, or add it to path manually which is a pain.
{% endhint %}

After you finished installing though, you can go back and continue the quick start guide!
