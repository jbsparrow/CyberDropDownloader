# Linux

You can easily check if you have python installed by running this command in terminal:

```sh
python3 --version
```

If you get an error instead of a version number, try doing it simply as:

```sh
python --version
```

If you see a version that is 3.11 or newer, you're set!

If you see a version number that is below 3.11, you'll need to update it.

If you still receive an error, you'll need to install it.

As for updating or installing python, there are too many different versions of Linux for me to include all the possible ways here. It would be best for you to google your version of Linux and how to install (or update) python.
