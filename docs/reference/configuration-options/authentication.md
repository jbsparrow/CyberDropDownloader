# Authentication

<details>

<summary>Coomer</summary>

In order to scrape your favorites from coomer, you need to provide Cyberdrop-DL with your coomer `session` cookie.

Once you have put your `session` cookie into the authentication file, you can add `https://coomer.su/favorites` to the URLs file, and Cyberdrop-DL will scrape your favorites.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Forums</summary>

In order to scrape links/content from forums, you need to provide Cyberdrop-DL with your login details so it can access the website. This section also includes cookies for the support forums.

If you use the cookie extractor to load the XF\_User\_Cookies into the program, you don't need to provide the program with credentials. If you ever log out of the forum in your browser though, you will need to use the cookie extractor again to get new cookies.

It is best to leave the authentication parameter for SimpCity blank, as they have made their forum public and have asked users scraping the website not to use logged in users.

In order to set specific authentication values for a config instead of the global values, make an `authentication.yaml` file in the config folder.

***

* \<forum>\_xf\_user\_cookie

This is the value for the cookie I was talking about above. If you want to only use credentials, you can leave this blank.

* \<forum>\_username

This is your username for the forum. Again, if you use the cookie, you don't need to provide this.

* \<forum>\_password

This is your password for the forum. Again, if you use the cookie, you don't need to provide this.
