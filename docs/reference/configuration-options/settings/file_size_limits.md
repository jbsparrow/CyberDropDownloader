# File Size Limits

You can provide the maximum and minimum file size for each file "type".

All options on this category take a `Bytes` input, which is an `int` representing a number of bytes with optional suffix with the unit. Ex: `6000000` and `6MB` are both valid values

Setting any of these options to `0` means `disabled`

|Type|Default|
