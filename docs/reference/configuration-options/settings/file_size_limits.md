# File Size Limits

You can provide the maximum and minimum file size for each file "type".

All options on this category take a `ByteSize` input ([more info here](../special_setting_types.md)).

| Type       | Default |
| ---------- | ------- |
| `ByteSize` | `0`     |

Setting any of these options to `0` means that limit is `disabled`

- `maximum_image_filesize`
- `minimum_image_filesize`
- `maximum_video_filesize`
- `minimum_video_filesize`
- `maximum_other_filesize`
- `minimum_other_filesize`
