# File Size Limits

You can provide the maximum and minimum file size for each file "type".

All options on this category take a `Bytes` input, which is an `int` representing a number of bytes with optional suffix with the unit. Ex: `6000000` and `6MB` are both valid values

|Type|Default|
|---|---|
|`ByteSize`|`0`|

Setting any of these options to `0` means that limit is `disabled`

- `maximum_image_filesize`
- `minimum_image_filesize`
- `maximum_video_filesize`
- `minimum_video_filesize`
- `maximum_other_filesize`
- `minimum_other_filesize`
