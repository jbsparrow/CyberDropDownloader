# Configuration Options

{% hint style="info" %}
There is a lot of possible customization that you can do with the program, don't worry though. I'll try and make it as easy as possible for you.
{% endhint %}

A little note on how configs work in V5:

There are three type of config files in V5.

* settings
* global\_settings
* authentication\_settings

Global settings and authentication settings are "global". **They apply to all settings configs**. You can set them once and never touch them again.

{% content-ref url="authentication.md" %}
[authentication.md](authentication.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="global-settings.md" %}
[global-settings.md](global-settings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Each settings config will be setup by default to have separate URLs.txt files and separate logs.

{% content-ref url="settings.md" %}
[settings.md](settings.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You can run all of the configs by selecting such from the UI.
