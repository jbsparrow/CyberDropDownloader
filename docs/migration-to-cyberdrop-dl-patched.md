# Migration to Cyberdrop-DL-Patched

To migrate to the patched version of Cyberdrop-DL, you can follow the steps below.

#### If you installed on your own using pip, you can simply uninstall the old version and install the new one using the following commands:

```shell

pip install cyberdrop-dl-patched
```

The command to use the new version will remain as `cyberdrop-dl`.

#### If you installed using the start files, you can find the new ones here:

[New start files](https://github.com/jbsparrow/CyberDropDownloader/releases/latest) If you have custom start files, you can follow the commands for the pip installation to uninstall the old package and install the new one. Then update your start files to install `cyberdrop-dl-patched` instead of `cyberdrop-dl`.
