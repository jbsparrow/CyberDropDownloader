# Transition from V4 or V5 to V6

{% hint style="danger" %}
V6 introduces some breaking changes: Using a more strict config validation logic, replacing `md5` with `xxh128` as the default hashing algorithm, using a new database schema, among others.

It's recommended to do a manual backup of your current `AppData` folder. You won't be able to rollback to a previous version after the transfer is completed.

You can learn more about these changes on the [release announcement](https://github.com/jbsparrow/CyberDropDownloader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600---2024-12-23)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even after a successful configuration migration, the program may not start if some values from the previous versionâ€™s config are no longer valid. Please follow the on-screen instructions to resolve the issue.

You can use the [Config Options page](reference/configuration-options/README.md) as reference for valid config values
{% endhint %}

## Import V5 config to V6

Good news! If you have a v5 config, no action is required. The program will automatically detect the config in the current folder and handle the migration process for you.

Please note that after the migration is complete, you may still need to manually adjust some values in the config.

If the migration fails, the database will be rolled back to its previous state. An automatic backup is also made before the migration begins. However, keep in mind that the backup only includes the database, not the config files.

## Import V4 config to V6

{% hint style="warning" %}
Support for v4 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. To upgrade to the latest version, you may need to perform a sequential upgrade. First, update CDL to the last version that supported v4 and then update to the latest version.

Last version with v4 support: `6.1.0`

You can install an specific version with pip by running:

```shell
pip install cyberdrop-dl-patched==VERSION
```

{% endhint %}

Built into Cyberdrop-DL is a tool that allows you to import both your configs and your history DB from a v4 version of Cyberdrop-DL. You can use it by selecting "Import V4 Items".

### Importing previous configs</a>

The config will be located in the folder that you were previously running Cyberdrop-DL in.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you weren't using the config previously, you don't need to import it.

However, if you were primarily using CLI Arguments with V4, some of the arguments will need to swapped into config options.
{% endhint %}

If you don't end up using the import feature, make sure you also change the default config in the program if that's something you want to do.

### Importing the old History DB</a>

For a lot of people, the `download_history.sqlite` file will be in the same folder as your start file (or wherever you are running Cyberdrop-DL).

If it's not there, you can find it here:

Windows:
```shell
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Cyberdrop-DL\Cyberdrop-DL\download_history.sqlite
```

macOS:
```shell
/Library/Application Support/Cyberdrop-DL/Cyberdrop-DL/download_history.sqlite
```

Linux:
```shell
/home/<USER>/.local/share/Cyberdrop-DL/Cyberdrop-DL/download_history.sqlite
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The old `download_history.sqlite` file is no longer used by Cyberdrop-DL. After you import it, you can delete the old one.

If you don't want to import previous download history, you can just delete it.
{% endhint %}
